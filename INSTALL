If you want to use the ALBUS software with CASA measurement sets you 
must install the casacore package from https://code.google.com/p/casacore/ 
and the pyrap package from https://code.google.com/p/pyrap/

If you do not need/want to work with CASA measurement sets, then at a minimum 
you need to have the Python numpy and PyEphem  (http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/)
packages installed.

You should download and install the PyCurl package needed to get data from 
remote GPS sites.

The ALBUS Ionosphere package should be able to install on most Linux
systems.  This code probably requires something close to the GNU make
to build, but you are welcome to test it with other systems,
and report back any problems.  The code should be able to run on most
"Unix"-like environments.

First, you need to edit the top-level Makefile to set various parameters.

Set the environment variable, INSTALLDIR to tell the system 
where you want final libraries and data used by the package to be installed. 
You can do this in the bash shell with e.g.

setenv INSTALLDIR /home/twillis/albus 

where you would replace /home/twillis/albus  with your own directory structure.
You should create this directory before you issue the 'make' command to start
the actual build.

Do you want to use debug mode by default? Under Linux Ubuntu 10.04 there seemed
to be some problems with gfortran and multiprocessing in optimised mode. Under 
ubuntu 12.04 things seem to work OK

export DEBUG=0

Then define the compiler. The following works for Ubuntu 18.04

export CC = gcc
export F77 = gfortran -std=legacy
export F77_COMPILER_LIB = gfortran
export F77_RECL_UNIT = bytes
export HAVE_G2C_H_FILE=0
export C++ = g++

export CPP = cpp -P

That should do it for the Makefile.

You may also need to edit the file

./C++/AlbusIonosphere/python_attempt/setup.py

to specify the location of the numpy include files as these locations seem 
to vary from one Linux to another. Examples that are known to work are shown 
in the setup.py file

You will probably need to add $INSTALLDIR/lib to your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and  $INSTALLDIR/share/python:$INSTALLDIR/lib to your 
PYTHONPATH environment variables. Add $INSTALLDIR/bin to ypur PATH environment
variable. If things have been set up correctly then you should be able to copy 
the getGPSIONO_3C138.py script from the examples subdirectory to 
any directory on your computer and run it from there.

You should update these environment variables before you start the build.

You need to have shared libraries for the flex lexical analyzer installed. 
This seems to happen if you install flex on an ubuntu linux system, but may not be the case by default for other linuxes.

To build, just run 'make' followed by 'make install'. That should work.

IMPORTANT: You will also need to install the conversion software programs 
contained in the file RNXCMP_4.1.0_src.tar.gz.  See the file 
RNXCMP_4.1.0_src/docs/RNXCMP.txt for instructions on compilation. Put the 
compiled binaries in some directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin) which will be in 
your search path for executable files. The script build_rnx_crx will install the
binaries in your /usr/local/bin directory

If you need to want to retrieve and use RINEX 3 files (at present, as far as
I know only needed for Australia since 2020) you need to a) obtain the program 
RX3name from the website http://acc.igs.org/software.html. This program will 
convert a RINEX 2 name to its RINEX 3 equivalent. ALBUS will then use the 
RINEX 3 name to query and obtain the RINEX 3 file from the server site, and
then b) obtain the program GFZRNX, also available at http://acc.igs.org/software.html. 
This program converts the RINEX 3 file into a RINEX 2 file for futher analysis
by the ALBUS package

If you decide to rebuild the software for some reason first run 'make clean',
followed by 'source remove_remainder'.

To run the software, edit the script getGPSIONO_3C138.py. Examples of usage are 
given at the end of the file, and also at the ends of other scripts, especially
MS_Iono_agw_azel_par.py in the python_scripts or examples subdirectory. 
The examples illustrate the various parameters that the system will accept. 
The process_ionosphere function in the MS_Iono_functions.py script gives 
definitions of all the parameters that you can set.

The flag do_serial, if set equal to 0 does parallel processing to download GPS 
station data sets. If do_serial is set to 1 the program will do the ftp 
sequentially, which can be slow. BUT if all the GPS data sets have been 
downloaded in a previous session it will just read the data from disk, 
using the station names contained in the file 'albus_good_stations'. 
Unfortunately if you use do_serial set to 0 to read in data that you have 
already collected then some python shared-memory bug gets triggered. 
This bug does not seem to have been fixed as of python 2.7

num_processors tells the system how many python ftp sessions can be spawned 
off in parallel. If you give a value <= 2 the system will check your CPU and
assign the number of processors on the basis of what it finds. If you have
set do_serial=1, this parameter will have no effect until the software reaches
the prediction stage. 

The processing will end up producing an ASCII file whose name begins with 
albus_report.  The columns in the report give:

column 0: sequence number
column 1: a colon !
column 2: will be 0, if the prediction calculation went OK, otherwise -1. 
  You will certainly get a -1 if the field goes below the horizon.
column 3: time, relative to the start time in seconds
column 4: time width of a sample, usuallly 300 seconds
column 5: elevation, in degrees
column 6: azimuth, in degrees
column 7; STEC, in TEC units
column 8: rotation measure in radians/m^2
column 9: factor by which to multiply STEC to get VTEC . Note - this is
purely a geometric correction. If you actually want the vertical TEC at 
a specified site, the example script vla_test.py, shows how use of the 
use_elev flag, set to True, allows you to do so.

See the file MS_Iono_agw_azel_par.py for documentation on the ionosphere 
processing_options. The MO_PIM and MO_IRI models are only theoretical, and 
sometimes do not come even close to what the actual GPS solutions give.
# The types of fits that can be selected for processing GPS data sets
# The valid RINEX groups are
PROCESSING_OPTION_RINEX_GROUPS = ["RI_G00",  # Single station, nearest sat
                                  "RI_G01",  # single station, all sats
                                  "RI_G02",  # simple 2D
                                  "RI_G03",  # 3D mult (same lat,lon for all h)
                                  "RI_G04",  # 3D many (different lat,lon for h)
                                  "RI_G05",  # 3D spherical harmonics
                                  "RI_G06",  # 2D with time dependance
                                  "RI_G07",  # 2D with gradient LSQ
                                  "RI_G08",  # 2D with time, gradient
                                  "RI_G09",  # 3D spherical, gradient
                                  ]

The GPS processing options you probably want to try are:
RI_G03
RI_G01
in decreasing order of preference. Processing_option = 'RI_G05' may also
give reasonable results. NOTE: If you only have data from a single GPS station
the RI_G03 solution seems to give OK TEC values but the RMs appear to 
be garbage

At present the function ionosphere_GPS_set_criteria in the file 
MS_Iono_functions.py is not actually called - instead, to adjust any 
parameters you need to edit MS_Iono_functions.py around line 495 or 
thereabouts.

NOTE: The MO_IRI option seems to produce zeros for STEC and RM, at least 
on a ubuntu 14.04 machine. The gfortran compiler may be having problems 
with the IRI Fortran code.  This needs further investigation. The code compiles
and runs OK on a ubuntu 12.04 machine.
