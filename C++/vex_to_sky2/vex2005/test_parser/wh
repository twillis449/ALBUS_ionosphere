*$Blocks
*
*The VEX file is divided into a number of separate ‘$blocks’, each beginning with ‘$blockname’ statement.
*There are several types of $blocks:
* 1.‘Primitive’ $blocks: Consist entirely of keyword ‘def blocks’ which define low-level station, source, and recording
*   parameters. The currently defined primitive $blocks and their use in various stages of the experiment
*   are summarized below:
*                                                                       Req’d in   SCHEDULING  DATA-TAKING  CORRELATION

*   The ‘.obs’ file, currently not fully defined, will contain additional $blocks.  Some of the $blocks are:
*         $ANTENNA_CAL_OBS ‘ As-observed’ Antenna calibration measurements
*         $CABLE_CAL_OBS   ‘ As-observed’ cable-calibration measurements
*         $CLOCK_OBS       ‘ As-observed’ clock-sync measurements
*         $SCHED_OBS       ‘ As-observed’ schedule
*         $PHASE_CAL_OBS   ‘ As-observed’ phase calibration measurements
*         $TAPELOG_OBS     ‘ As-observed’ tape-usage log
*         $TSYS_OBS        ‘ As-observed’ system-temperature measurements
*         $WX_OBS          ‘ As-observed’ weather measurements
* 2. $GLOBAL block: Specifies global/general experiment parameters as ‘refs’ to primitive-block keywords.
* 3. $STATION/$MODE blocks: Define station and mode keywords in ‘def’ blocks which contains ‘refs’ to primitive-block
*    keywords.  The combination of a $STATION key, $MODE key, plus the $GLOBAL parameters specify the detailed
*    configuration for an observation at a particular station.
* 4. $SCHED block: specifies a detailed time-ordered list of observations, using keyword references to $STATION, $MODE
*    and $SOURCE ‘defs’. (Time-ordering requirement may be removed in future.)
*
* Additional $block types may be added for special purposes.  The order of the $blocks is irrelevant except
* for convenience and readability.  In this example VEX file, the numerous primitive $blocks are simply ordered
* alphabetically.
*
***********************************************************************************************************************
*
*Hi-level Organization Rules:
*
* 1. The first line in the VEX file identifies the file type and must be of the form ‘VEX_rev = <VEX rev level>;‘
*    followed by an optional comment (prefaced with a ‘*’).
* 2. Except for the first line, the active (i.e. non-comment) statements in a VEX file consist entirely of blocks
*    separated (and named) by ‘$BLOCKNAME;’ statements.  For convenience, we will refer to those blocks as ‘$blocks’
*    or ‘sections’.
* 3. The ‘$BLOCKNAME;’ statement is the first statement in a $block and names the $block.
* 4. A $block is terminated by the specification of another ‘$BLOCKNAME;’ statement.
* 5. ‘$BLOCKNAME’ may contain no embedded spaces.
* 6. $blocks may be in any order, though they are normally organized for convenience and readability.
* 7. Additional $blocks may be added as necessary.
*
***********************************************************************************************************************
*
*$block Types
*
* $blocks are divided into three types:
*   1. ‘Primitive’ $blocks  - each primitive $block serves to define a set or sets of parameters (via keyword ‘defs’)
*                             with no direct reference to any other $blocks (except perhaps to an external database 
*                             file).
*   2. ‘High-level’ $blocks - made up entirely of references to primitive-block keywords to construct the full
*                             suite of parameters necessary to specify an experiment.  The $GLOBAL, $STATION,
*                             and $MODE blocks are the currently-defined ‘high-level’ blocks.
*   3. $SCHED block         - entries necessary to drive the observation schedule.
*                             Has a special format and includes references to $STATION, $MODE and $SOURCE blocks.
*
***********************************************************************************************************************
*
*Syntax Rules:
*
* General
*    1. Upper/lower case is relevant in VEX statements.
*    2. All VEX statements start with $blockname, ‘def’, ‘enddef’, ‘ref’, ‘scan’, ‘endscan’, ‘start_literal()’,
*       ‘end_literal()’ or ‘<parameter>=‘.
*    3. VEX puncuation characters are:
*          ‘=‘ - assignment of a keyword or parameter value
*          ‘:’ - delineator between subfields in the assignment of parameter value(s).
*          ‘;’ - terminates a VEX statement
*          ‘ ‘ - (white space) in special cases.  See White Space Rules below.
*    4. Multiple statements may occur on a single line.
*    5. A single statement may span multiple lines.
*    6. The maximum length of any block name, file name, parameter name, parameter value, or link word is
*       128 characters.
*    7. All link words  (and only link words) begin with the ‘&’ character.
*    8. White Space Rules -
*       a. No white space is permitted within block names, keywords, file names, parameter names or values *except*:
*          at least one white space must separate a numerical parameter value from its units (e.g. ‘10 sec’).
*       b. At least one white space must follow ‘def’, ‘ref’ or ‘scan’ (e.g. ‘ref $FREQ’).
*       c. No white space (or anything else) may occur before the ‘VEX_rev=‘ statement at the beginning of the VEX
*          file.
*       d. With the above exceptions, an arbitrary amount (including zero) of white space is allowed anywhere within
*          a VEX file.
*       e. For purposes of parsing, an <end-of-line> character is equivalent to one white-space character, except that
*          an <end-of-line> unconditionally terminates a comment.
*    9. There are no column specifications in the VEX format, other than those imposed by the discipline of the
*       user for easy readability.  A ‘literal block’, however, may have column restrictions/specifications which
*       fall outside of the VEX format specification.
*
* Legal Character Set
*    1. The character set is confined to standard 7-bit ASCII, except that the null character is prohibited anywhere,
*       including any literal blocks.
*    2. Block names, keywords, link names and parameter names may not contain quoted characters strings and may not
*       contain any of the characters ‘$&;:=‘.
*    3. Quoted character strings are allowed as parameter values in parameter-assignment statements.
*    3. Quoted character strings must start and end with a double-quote (“).  Quoted strings follow the usual C 
*       quoting conventions for character strings, except that a null character may not be specified.  The length
*       of a quoted string is the length of the resulting characters, not the quoted representation.
*    4. Literal blocks fall outside of the normal VEX construction rules and may contain any characters except null.
*
* Comments
*    1. A non-quoted asterisk (‘*’) character at any point on a line denotes the beginning of a comment.
*       The asterisk and the remainder of the line are ignored.
*    2. Comments may not be embedded within a multi-line VEX statement.
*    3. A comments may contain any standard 7-bit ASCII character except null.
*    4. For purposes of parsing, a comment is considered to be equivalent to a single space character.
*    5. A point of philisophy: Software should strive to retain comments whenever a VEX file is processed.
*
* ‘def’ Construct:
*    1. The ‘def’ block is used to assign a keyword name to a set of specified parameters values.
*    2. The ‘def’ block is the ONLY way to specify parameter values.
*    3 ‘def’ blocks are allowed in most $block sections, but specifically prohibited in the $GLOBAL and $SCHED
*       blocks.
*    4. The structure of each def block is:
*         def <keyword>;                                      *define keyword
*           The following are possible statements within a ‘def’:
*           <parameter>=<list_of_values>;                     *direct setting of parameter values;
*                                                             *permitted only in ‘primitive’ $blocks
*           ref <external filename>:<$blockname>=<keyword>;   *set parameter values by reference to external source;
*                                                             *permitted only in ‘primitive’ $blocks.
*                                                             *Not permitted in ‘.skd’ (which must be self-contained)
*           ref <primitive $blockname>=<keyword>;             *set parameters according to referenced ‘def’ block;
*                                                             *permitted only in $GLOBAL, $STATION, $MODE $blocks
*           ref <primitive $blockname>=<keyword>:<qualifier>; *qualify the referenced ‘def’-block parameters according
*                                                             *to station, time, etc (see ‘ref’ Construct rules).
*            .
*         enddef;
*    5. At least one space (or <end-of-line> character) must follow the word ‘def’.
*    6. <keyword> can be up to 32 characters long.  Embedded spaces are not permitted.
*    7. <keyword> must be unique within the $block.
*    8. Any number of ‘<parameter>=‘ or ‘ref’ statements may occur within the ‘def’.
*    9. The order of statements within a ‘def’ is irrelevant.
*   10. A ‘def’ without a corresponding ‘ref’ may as well not exist.
*   11. The order of ‘def’ blocks within a $block is irrelevant.
*
* <parameter>=<list_of_values> Construct:
*    1. Permitted only in primitive-block ‘defs’ (except for special rules in $SCHED block).
*    2. The specification of any particular parameter is permitted only within the primitive $block to which
*       it is assigned (see VEX Parameter Tables).
*    3. Max length is 32 chars.  No embedded spaces are permitted.
*    4. The number and type of <list_of_values> must be consistent with the definition specified in the
*       VEX Parameter Tables.
*    5. Entries within the <list_of_values> are separated by colon (‘:’)characters.  Each such colon may be
*       surrounded by zero or more white spaces.
*    6 .Each value in the <list_of_values> must be of one of the following types:
*         a. Real/Integer
*              Examples of acceptable values: -1.234, +5.67e-12, -.987E+04, 0.267e2, -871
*              Followed by units specification if required.
*              Unit specification, if present, must be separated by one or more spaces.
*         b. Character
*              A character string may be specified either with or without surrounding quotes:
*                With quotes - All characters between the quotes, including white space, will be parsed as
*                              part of the character string (example: “Character string”).
*                              Legal characters are “A-Za-z0-9_/-+”.
*                Without quotes - No embedded spaces are allowed.  Character string is assumed to start with
*                              first non-space character and end with last non-space character before terminating
*                              colon or semi-colon.  Normal C-language quoting conventions are observed, except
*                              that no null bytes may be present.
*         c. Epoch
*              ‘Epoch’ is specification of a particular instant of time is and is always expressed as
*              UTC ‘##y###d##h##m##.###s’ where ‘#’ is a numeral, ‘###d’ is day-of-year (1-366),
*              ‘##h’ is hour (0-23), ‘##m’ is minute (0-59) and ‘##.###s’ are seconds (0-59.999..).
*              Only the seconds sub-field may contain a non-integer (i.e. real) value.
*              ‘Year may be either 4-characters (e.g.‘1997y’) or 2-characters (e.g.‘97y’).  If appropriate,
*              epoch may be truncated from the right (e.g. ‘97y263d12h’) with implied 0’s for unspecified fields.
*         d. RA/Dec
*              Source position specified in ra/dec use an abbreviated form of units, of the form
*              ‘ra=##h##m##.###s; dec=##d##’##.###” (e.g. ra=05h23m2.56s; dec=-20d45’12.2”;)
*         e. &link
*              See ‘Links’ section below.
*    7. Unit Specifications
*       a. Integer or real values with units of time, freq, sample rate, length, angle, angular-rate and flux
*          may require the explicit specification of units, as specified in the VEX Parameter Tables:
*               time      -   ‘psec’, ‘nsec’, ‘usec’, ‘msec’, ‘sec’, ‘min’, ‘hr’, ‘yr’
*               frequency -   ‘mHz’, ‘Hz’, ‘kHz’, ‘MHz’, ‘GHz’
*               sample rate-  ‘ks/sec’, ‘Ms/sec’
*               length    -   ‘um’, ‘mm’, ‘cm’, ‘m’, ‘km’, ‘in’, ‘ft’
*               angle     -   ‘mdeg’, ‘deg’, ‘amin’, ‘asec’, ‘rad’  (exception - source position: see below)
*               ang rate  -   ‘<angle>/<time>‘, where <angle> and <time> are any valid units
*               velocity  -   ‘<length>/<time>‘, where <length> and <time> are any valid units
*               flux      -   ‘mJy’ ‘Jy’
*               bit density - ’bpi’, ‘kbpi’
*          Unit specifications follow, separated by one or more spaces, the numerical value to which they refer.
*          In cases where a parameter statement ends with a variable-length list of numerical values which take the
*          same units, the first field of the list must have specified units, but the following values may omit them,
*          causing them to default to the same units.  [Note, however, for parameter statements with a fixed number
*          of fields, units must always be specified.  Thus, for example, ‘source_model’ and ‘pointing_sector’
*          require units for all relevant fields, but ‘horizon_map_az’ ‘ut1-utc’ and ‘switching_cycle’ do not.]
*
* ref <external filename>:<$blockname>=<keyword> Construct:
*    1. Permitted only within primitive ‘defs’ to get lists of <parameter>=<list_of_values> statements from
*       an external source.
*    2. <$blockname> is the $block name to be searched in the external file (Normally, this would be the same
*       as the VEX file primitive $blockname in which this statement occurs).
*    3. <keyword> is a defined keyword in the <$blockname> block of the external file.
*    4. The syntax rules and construct rules for the external file are identical to the rules for primitive $blocks.
*    5. The order of ‘refs’ within a ‘def’ is irrelevant.
*    6. At least one space (or <end-of-line> character) must follow the word ‘ref’.
*
* ref <primitive $blockname>=<keyword>[:<qualifier>] Construct:
*    1. Permitted only within $GLOBAL, $STATION, $MODE blocks.
*    2. <keyword> is a defined ‘def’ keyword within the specified <primitive $blockname>.
*    3. Within a $STATION or $MODE ‘def’ block, there may be multiple ‘refs’ to the same primitive $block
*       (with distinct keywords).  In this case, the parameter values associated with the multiple ‘refs’
*       are simply concatenated.  No conflicting or duplicate parameters are permitted.
*    4. <qualifier> is an optional parameter that may be used only in the $MODE block to qualify
*       a ‘ref’ by station(s) (appropriate $STATION keywords, separated by colons).  If <qualifier>
*       is not present, the ‘ref’ statement is assumed to apply to all stations.
*    5. The order of ‘refs’ within a ‘def’ or within the $GLOBAL block is irrelevant.
*    6. At least one space (or <end-of-line> character) must follow the word ‘ref’.
*
* Links
*    ‘Links’ are cross-references made through the use of ‘linkwords’ in the <list_of_values> part of various
*     <parameter>=<list_of_values> statements.  They serve to link together the myriad of details
*     regarding station and recording configurations in the selected defs’.  There is, for example,
*     heavy reliance on ‘links’ between the $FREQ, $BBC, $IF and $TRACKS blocks in order to specify
*     the detailed RF, IF, BBC and configurations.  For clarity, linkwords require a ‘&’ as the first character
*     of their name, but are otherwise arbitrary using the normally-valid character set. Embedded spaces are
*     not permitted.  Linkwords may be up to 32 characters long.  To understand the concept of ‘links’ it may useful
*     to examine the following $blocks in order: $FREQ >> $BBC >> $IF, $FREQ >> $TRACKS.
*
* Literal Block Construct
*    1. A block of text may be declared as ‘literal’ if the block is preceded by a ‘start_literal();’ statement
*       and terminated by an ‘end_literal();’ statement, as follows:
*                start_literal(<string>);          *’start_literal’ statement must be last VEX statement on line
*                   <first line of literal text>
*                     .
*                     .
*                   <last line of literal text>
*                 end_literal(<string>);           *’end_literal’ statement must be first VEX statement on line
*       where <string> is optional (i.e. may be empty) and may be arbitrarily chosen to avoid any spurious
*       interpretation of an embedded ‘end_literal()’ statement. <string> may not contain ‘()’, null or new-line
*       characters, but all other 7-bit characters are valid including white space.
*    2. The literal block starts on the first line following the ‘start_literal’ statement and ends on the last
*       line before the ‘end_literal’ statement.
*    3. Any ASCII characters except null are allowed within a literal block.
*    4. A literal block may only occur within a ‘def’ block.
*    5. Parsing of a literal block is outside the VEX-format specification.
*       Note: At this time, the literal block is used only in the $SCHEDULING_PARAMS block.

$GLOBAL; *global default parameters
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*$GLOBAL block rules:
*    1. Purpose is to specify global/general information as appropriate.
*    2. Only ‘refs’ to primitive-block keywords are permitted.
*    3. ‘refs’ to any primitive $blocks are permitted and are concatenated with ‘refs’ in the $STATION and $MODE
*        blocks.  No conflicting or duplicated parameters are permitted in the concatenation.
*
    ref $EXPER = EXP1387; *general experiment information
    ref $SCHEDULING_PARAMS = SKED1; *choose scheduling program/parameters
    ref $PROCEDURES = STANDARD1; *general-procedure timing parameters
    ref $EOP = EOP129; *earth-orientation parameters
*
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$STATION; *station parameters
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*$STATION $block rules:
*    1. Consists exclusively of ‘def’ blocks.
*    2. Within ‘def’ blocks, only ‘refs’ to primitive-block keywords are permitted.
*    3. For each observation in the $SCHED block, the set of parameters specified by the selected $STATION
*       and $MODE keywords are concatenated with the parameters specified in the $GLOBAL block to form
*       the full set of observing parameters for each station in that observation.
*       Conflicting or duplicate parameters within the the concatenated parameter set are not permitted.
*    4. Multiple ‘refs’ to keys within the same primitive $block are simply concatenated.
*    5. The $STATION ‘defs’ must contain all ‘refs’ to $SITE and $ANTENNA primitive blocks.
*       Otherwise, ‘refs’ to any primitive $block are permitted in either the $STATION or $MODE section.
*       Generally, parameters that are fixed at a given station for the entire experiment should be
*       placed in the $STATION ‘def’. Parameters that may change from observation to observation must be
*       placed in the $MODE ‘defs’.
*    6. Parameter values implied by the ‘refs’ in the $GLOBAL, $STATION or $MODE blocks must not conflict
*       (i.e. there must be no more than one value specified for a single parameter).
*
*Notes:
*    1. The requirement that only ‘refs’ are allowed in the $STATION/$MODE blocks may seem somewhat awkward since
*       some of the ‘refs’ refer to single-parameters primitive-’defs’.  The advantage, however, is that this
*       rule forces all parameter values to be set in the primitive $block to which they are uniquely assigned,
*       eliminating any possible confusion about their meaning.
*    2. A ‘station’ consists of an ANTENNA on a SITE with a data-acquisition system (DAS).
*       The $STATION block is intended for the specification of parameters which truly are associated with each
*       station and will remain fixed for the duration of the experiment at each station.
*
*Special cases:
*    1. Multiple antennas at one location:
*       Each antenna is defined separately in the $STATION block and must have its own $SITE ‘def’.
*       If the antennas are identical, they may reference the same $ANTENNA ‘def’.
*    2. Multiple antennas sharing a single data-acquisition system (antenna cluster):
*       If two or more antennas share the same DAS, the $STATION ‘defs’ for the corresponding antennas must have
*       ‘refs’ to exactly the same set of $DAS keywords, including particularly the ‘recording_system_ID’ parameter
*       (which identifies the particlar DAS), except that one (and only one) of the stations must declare itself
*       as the tape-control master with the inclusion of a ‘tape_control=master;’ statement within the referenced
*       $DAS ‘defs’ for that station (this will cause the tape to be controlled according to the schedule of that
*       station; the others will simply point).  The $FREQ ‘def’ selected for each station, along with the corresponding
*       selected $BBC and $IF ‘defs’, define the channels recorded from each antenna.  Normally, all stations will
*       reference the same ‘defs’ in the $TRACK, $ROLL, $HEAD_POS, $PASS_ORDER blocks (depending on type of DAS),
*       but care must be taken to ascertain that the combination of specified recordings is compatible with the DAS.

*$MODE block rules: See $STATION block rules.
*
*Notes:
*    1. The $MODE block is intended to specify the detailed station setup parameters that may change from
*       observation to observation.
*    2. A powerful capability of the ‘ref’s in the $MODE block is the ability to qualify them by station, so that the
*       specification of a single $MODE key automatically configures each station according to the details of its
*       particular observing equipment and capabilities.
*    3. A ‘ref <$blockname> = <keyword>:<$stationkey(s)>;’ statement is applied only to the station(s) specified.
*       A ‘ref <$blockname> = <keyword>;’ statement with no qualifiers is applicable to all stations.

*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$SCHED; *schedule block
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*The $SCHED block specifies the actual scans to be taken.
*
*$SCHED block rules:
*  1. Each scan is specified by ‘scan <scan_ID>‘. This (arbitrary) ‘scan ID’ will carry through
*     into the log files and log-summary files to serve as a convenient reference to identify particular scans.
*     All <scan_ID>‘s within the $SCHED block must be unique.
*  2. The ‘scan’ must include the appropriate ‘start=‘, ‘source=‘, ‘mode=‘ and ‘station=‘ statements.
*  3. The nominal start time of a scan is specified by a ‘start=‘ statement, as follows:
*           start=<epoch>
*     where <epoch> is in the VEX <epoch> format [typically ‘##y###d##h##m##.##s’].
*     The ‘start=‘ time must be chosen to be the expected time of first good data at any station in the ‘scan’.
*  4  The ‘scan’ blocks must be in time order by ‘start=‘ times, although adjacent scans may have the
*     same ‘start=‘ time (for example, if each of two antennas is to be pointed at different sources starting at
*     the same time).
*  5. Source references are of the form
*           source=<$SOURCEkey>
*     where <$SOURCEkey> is the desired keyword defined in the $SOURCE block
*  6. Mode references are of the form
*           mode=<$MODEkey>
*     where <$MODEkey> is the desired keyword defined in the $MODE block.
*  7. Each station participating in the scan is specified in a separate ‘station=‘ statement of the form:
*       station=$STATIONkey:datastart:datastop:startpos:pass:pointsectr:tapedrive(s)
*         where
*           $STATIONkey  station keyword from $STATION block
*           startpos     In start/stop mode: nominal tape-start position (feet or meters).
*                        Null if dynamic tape allocation, or if tape is running continuously from last scan.
*                        For S2, startpos may be specified in terms of running time from the beginning of tape
*                        (specifiable in minutes or seconds only, not in hour-minute-second format).
*           datastart    Nominal start time of good data (i.e. antenna on-source) wrt ‘start=‘ time.
*                        Must be specified and must be >=0.
*                        Note that the tape may have started earlier if an early start has been specified
*                        by a ‘tape_motion=start&stop:<earlystart>‘ parameter in the $DAS block.
*           datastop     Nominal stop time of good data (i.e. antenna off-source) wrt ‘start=‘ time.
*                        Must be specified and must be greater than ‘datastart’.
*           pass         specifies tape pass as a numeric headstack-position reference plus an alphabetic subpass
*                        identifier (examples: 1A, 12D) as defined in the referenced $TRACKS and $HEAD_POS ‘def’ blocks
*                        pertaining to that station.  For S2, specifies group number.  Null if pass if not specified
*                        (i.e. dynamic tape allocation)
*                        or if irrelevant to the recording system.
*           pointsectr   specifies, if necessary, the antenna-pointing sector (as defined by a ‘linkword’ in the
*                        $ANTENNA block).  If null, cable-wrap considerations are considered not relevant.
*           drive        physical drive#.  If null, dynamic tape allocation is assumed.
*                        [Technically, the drive# specified here is added to the ‘drive-number offset’ specified
*                         in the $DAS section, which is normally specified =0.  In the case of multiple simultaneous
*                         drives, two (or more) different ‘drive-number offsets’ in the $DAS section
*                        (normally 0 and 1) automatically specify the proper physical drives to be used.]
*  8   The ‘mode=..‘, ‘source=..‘ and ‘station=..’ statements are obviously shorthand replacements for 
*      ‘ref $MODE=  ‘, ‘ref $SOURCE=..’, ref $STATION=  ‘, respectively, which may also be used.  The shorthand 
*      replacements are allowed only in $SCHED block, and are intended for easy readability of the schedule.
*  9.  Multiple ‘station=XY...’ statements (where XY is some station) may be written within a single scan block so
*      long as they specify non-overlapping recording periods.  This might be the case, for example, if the tape must
*      reverse direction one or more times at a station during a long scan.
*
*Notes:
*   1. The $SCHED block needs to contain only the information needed to acquire the data.
*      Depending on the scheduling procedure and/or particular antenna, some information such as passkey, startfoot
*      and/or pointing-sector may not be need to be specified.
*   2. The set of stations specified for a single scan must include all stations needed to form the desired
*      set of baselines to be correlated (though not all possible baselines will necessarily be correlated).
*      In cases of complicated clustering or subnetting, the correlator may, in some cases, be required to create
*      composite scans spanning more than one ‘scan’ block.
*   3. For purposes of processing multiple sources within a beam, multiple ‘source=‘ statements are permitted for
*      each scan.  The antenna will be directed to point to the first source listed; if pointing to the
*      center of a group of multiple sources within a beam, the first ‘source=‘ statement may be a reference to a
*      source of ‘source_type=dummy’ (in the $SOURCE def) that is used for pointing purposes only and will be ignored
*      by the correlator.
*   4. Each scan specified in the $SCHED block stands completely on its own as far as all details of station
*      and recording configurations are concerned.  This allows complicated switching between frequencies and/or
*      recording modes to be executed with relative ease, and also allows a rearrangement of the schedule without
*      the potential of lost configuration information.
*   5. For the special case of multiple antennas sharing the same DAS (antenna cluster):
*       a. One of the stations in the cluster must be declared as the master tape controller with the inclusion of
*          a ‘tape_control=master;’ statement included within referenced $DAS ‘defs’ for that station.
*          This will cause the tape to be controlled according to the schedule of that station; (i.e. the other
*          stations in the cluster will only point).  In this case, the ‘strt pos’, ‘pass’ and ‘drive’ sub-fields
*          in the ‘station=‘ statement will be null (they will eventually be filled in in the $SCHED_OBS block, however).
*       b. Apart from the tape-control aspect mentioned above, each of the antennas in a cluster act as independent
*          stations and scheduled as such within the $SCHED block.

$FREQ; *frequency and channel parameters
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*The $FREQ block specifies the polarization, sideband, channel bandwidth and exact RF sky frequency of each channel to
*be recorded in an observation.  In a simple experiment with all stations recording the same set of channels, a ‘ref’
*to a single $FREQ ’def’ will generally serve for all stations; in this case, the ‘ref $FREQ=<keyword>;’
*statement may be placed in the $GLOBAL block, individually for each station in the $STATION ‘defs’, or as a single
*’ref’ in the appropriate $MODE ‘def’.  In more complicated situations, more than one $FREQ ‘def’ may have to be
*referenced (as, for instance, in the example of this file).
*
*Notes:
*  1. All ‘chan_def=‘ statements referenced with respect to a given observation are assumed to be active recorded channels.
*  2. ‘Band_ID’ is a RF-freq-band ID which ‘links’ to the $SOURCE section (used for scheduling purposes only).
*  3. ‘Trks_ID’ is an identifier which ‘links’ to the selected $TRACKS block to define the data layout on tape for that
*     frequency channel.  If frequency switching is being used, more than one channel may have the same ‘Trks_ID’.
*  4. ‘BBC_ID’ is a BBC identifier which ‘links’ to the selected $BBC block to define the physical
*     BBC assignment for each frequency channel.
*  5. ‘Phase-cal_ID’ is a phase-cal identifer which ‘links’ to the selected ‘def’ in the $PHASE_CAL_DETECT block
*     to specify the phase-cal frequencies to be detected at a particular station.  A null ‘Phase-cal_ID’ field
*     implies no phase-cal will be detected in the corresponding channel; the same result can be achieved by specifying
*     a ‘Phase-cal ID’ which links to a ‘Phase-cal detect=‘ statement with no tones specified.

$IF; *receiver and IF parameters
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*Notes:
* 1. The $IF block serves to define the IF bands and phase-cal frequencies used in the observations.
* 2. The ‘IF ID’ is a link to the selected $BBC block and $SEFD block (used for scheduling only).
* 3. The ‘Physical Name’ is the IF letter or number specifying which IF is selected.  For the VLBA system, IF’s
*    A,B,C,D may each be selected with either a ‘Normal’ or ‘External’ input, leading to designations ‘AN’,‘AE’,‘BN’,
*    ‘BE’, ‘CN’, ‘CE’, ‘DN’, ‘DE’.  For the Mark III system, IF’s 1,2,3 may each be selected with either a ‘Normal’
*    or ‘Alternate’ input, leading to the designations ‘1N’, ‘1A’, ‘2N’, ‘2A’, ‘3N’, ‘3A’.
* 4. The ‘Total LO’ is the effective total LO frequency (not including BBC LO’s) for the associated IF band.
*    The ‘Total LO’, in combination with the sky frequency in the $FREQ block, allows the LO frequencies in the
*    individual BBC’s to be computed.
* 5. ‘Net SB’ is the net frequency sideband (‘U’ or ‘L’) of the IF itself.
* 6. ‘Phase-cal freq spacing’ may be ‘off’ for the case of no phase-cal.

*
*Notes:

*    channel.
* 2. Phase-cal detection will be done on the set of specified ‘tone#’s, which are listed in order of preference in
*    case more tones are specified than can be detected.  The tones are numbered positively from the low (DC) edge
*    of the BBC output band, with tone number ‘1’ being the first tone *above* DC.  Tones may also be specified as
*    negative numbers corresponding to their position from the bandedge, with tone number ‘-1’ being the first tone
*    *below* bandedge.  A tone number of ‘0’ specifies state counting, rather than phase-cal detection, should take
*    place.

*Notes:
* 1. Barrel-roll tables are extremely detailed in order to take advantage of flexibility in Mark 4 formatter.
*    The VLBA formatter supports a small subset of the possible Mark 4 barrel-roll modes.
* 2. The ‘home trk’ parameter in the ‘roll=‘ statement is the track to which data would be written if barrel-roll
*    is not active.  The ‘output track’ is the actual track to which data is written, specified at each step of the roll.

$TRACKS; *track mapping/multiplex parameters

*
*Notes:
*  1.‘Trks_ID’ is a link to the $FREQ block.
*  2. All ‘Trks_ID’s defined in a selected $FREQ ‘def’ must be present in the selected $TRACKS ‘def’.
*  3. Except for the ‘VLBA_drive_sys_track=‘ statement, all references to ‘track numbers’ in the $TRACKS block are more
*     properly labelled as ‘formatter-output numbers’ since signal switching within the recorder may lead to
*     re-arranged physical track assignments.  The ‘track number’ label has been retained for convenience.
*  4. When recording 2-bit samples, the bits are identified as ‘sign’ and ‘mag’, as defined in Mark IV memo 205.7.
*     The samples are actually encoded as ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’, ‘11’, in order, going from most negative to most positive
*     voltage.  The first bit (MSB) is truly the sign, while the second bit (LSB) is encoded for statistical uniformity
*     to keep the tape channel happier.  The designation ‘sign’ and ‘mag’ is used here, even though not quite correct,
*     so that the 1-bit sample case is designated as ‘sign’, which is both accurate and more comfortable than ‘MSB’.
