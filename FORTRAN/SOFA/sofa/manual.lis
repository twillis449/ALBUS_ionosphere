                  -------------------------------
                  THE IAU-SOFA SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
                  -------------------------------


    SOFA stands for "Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy".  The SOFA
    software libraries are a collection of subprograms, in source-
    code form, which implement official IAU algorithms for fundamental-
    astronomy computations.   The subprograms at present comprise 69
    "astronomy" routines supported by 52 "vector/matrix" routines, all
    written in Fortran.  In the future the number of astronomy routines
    will increase, and implementations in other languages will be
    introduced.


THE SOFA INITIATIVE

The IAU set up the SOFA initiative at the 1994 General Assembly, to
promulgate an authoritative set of fundamental-astronomy constants and
algorithms.  At the subsequent General Assembly, in 1997, the appointment
of a SOFA Review Board and the selection of a site for the SOFA Center
(the outlet for SOFA products) were announced.

The SOFA initiative was originally proposed by the IAU Working Group on
Astronomical Standards (WGAS), under the chairmanship of Toshio Fukushima.
The proposal was for "...new arrangements to establish and maintain an
accessible and authoritative set of constants, algorithms and procedures
that implement standard models used in fundamental astronomy".  The SOFA
Software Libraries implement the "algorithms" part of the SOFA initiative.
They were developed under the supervision of an international panel
called the SOFA Review Board.  The current membership of this panel is
listed in an appendix.

The SOFA Review Board is now part of Task 5 (Computation Tools) of the IAU
Working Group on the International Celestial Reference System (WGICRS),
which is part of Division 1 (Fundamental Astronomy).  The same person
chairs both the SOFA Review Board and WGICRS Task 5.

A feature of the original SOFA software proposals was that the products
would be self-contained and not depend on other software.  This includes
basic documentation, which, like the present file, will be plain ASCII
text.  It should also be noted that there is no assumption that the
software will be used on a particular computer and Operating System.
Although OS-related facilities may be present (Unix make files for
instance, use by the SOFA Center of automatic code management systems,
HTML versions of some documentation), the routines themselves will be
visible as individual text files and will run on a variety of platforms.


ALGORITHMS

The SOFA Review Board's initial goal has been to create a set of callable
subprograms.  Whether "subroutines" or "functions", they are all referred
to simply as "routines".  They are designed for use by software developers
wishing to write complete applications;  no runnable, free-standing
applications are included in SOFA's present plans.

The algorithms are drawn from a variety of sources.  Because most of the
routines so far developed have either been standard "text-book" operations
or implement well-documented standard algorithms, it has not been
necessary to invite the whole community to submit algorithms, though
consultation with authorities has occurred where necessary.  It should
also be noted that consistency with the conventions published by the
International Earth Rotation Service was a stipulation in the original
SOFA proposals, further constraining the software designs. This state of
affairs will continue to exist for some time, as there is a large backlog
of agreed extensions to work on.  However, in the future the Board may
decide to call for proposals, and is in the meantime willing to look into
any suggestions that are received by the SOFA Center.


SCOPE

The routines currently available are listed in the next two chapters of
this document.

The "astronomy" library comprises 69 routines.  Coverage is limited in
this early release, but the areas addressed include calendars, timescales,
ephemerides, precession/nutation, star space-motion, and star catalog
conversions.

The "vector-matrix" library, comprising 52 routines, contains a collection
of simple tools for manipulating the vectors, matrices and angles used by
the astronomy routines.  Although this library can be used in its own
right, it is limited in scope to what the other SOFA routines require.
Some users may be better served by the many specialist libraries available
elsewhere.

There is no explicit commitment by SOFA to support historical models,
though as time goes on a legacy of superseded models will naturally
accumulate.  There is, for example, no support of B1950/FK4 star
coordinates, or pre-1976 precession models, though these capabilities
will be added if there is a demand.

Though the SOFA software libraries are rather limited in scope, and are
likely to remain so for a considerable time, they do offer distinct
advantages to prospective users.  In particular, the routines are:

  * authoritative:  they are IAU-backed and have been constructed with
    great care;

  * practical:  they are straightforward to use in spite of being
    precise and rigorous (to some stated degree);

  * accessible and supported: they are downloadable from an easy-to-
    find place, they are in an integrated and consistent form, they
    come with adequate internal documentation, and help for users is
    available.


VERSIONS

Once it has been published, an issue will not be revised or updated and
will remain accessible indefinitely.  Subsequent issues may, however,
include corrected versions under the original filename and routine name.
However, where a different model is introduced, it will have a different
name.

The issues will be referred to by the date when they were announced.  The
frequency of re-issue will be decided by the Board, taking into account
the importance of the changes and the impact on the user community.


DOCUMENTATION

At present there is little or no free-standing documentation about
individual routines.  However, each routine has preamble comments which
specify in detail what the routine does and how it is used.


PROGRAMMING STANDARDS

The first release is in Fortran 77 only.  Work on C equivalents is about
to start, and related software in other languages is being considered.

The Fortran code conforms to ANSI X3.9-1978 in all but two minor respects:
each has an IMPLICIT NONE declaration, and its name has a prefix of "iau_"
and may be longer than 6 characters.  A global edit to erase both of these
will produce ANSI-compliant code with no change in its function.

Fortran coding style, and restrictions on the range of language features,
have been much debated by the Board, and the results comply with the
majority view.  There is (at present) no document that sets out the
standard, but the code itself offers a wide range of examples of what is
acceptable.

The routines contain explicit numerical constants (the INCLUDE statement
is not part of ANSI Fortran 77).  These are drawn from the file consts.lis,
which is listed in an appendix.


COPYRIGHT ISSUES

Copyright for all of the SOFA software and documentation is owned by the
IAU SOFA Review Board.  The Software is made available free of charge for
use by private individuals for non-profit research and by non-profit
educational, academic and research institutions.  Potential commercial
users of the Software should contact the Board.

Further details are included in the block of comments which concludes
every routine.  This block of comments is also given as an appendix to
the present document.


ACCURACY

The SOFA policy is to organize the calculations so that the machine
accuracy is fully exploited.  The gap between the precision of the
underlying model or theory and the computational resolution has to
be kept as large as possible, hopefully leaving several orders
of magnitude of headroom.

The SOFA routines in some cases involve design compromises between
rigor and ease of use (and also speed, though nowadays this is
seldom a major concern).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Board is indebted to a number of contributors, who are acknowledged in
the preamble comments of the routines concerned.

The Board's effort is provided by the members' individual institutes.
Resources for operating the SOFA Center and for chairing the SOFA Review
Board are provided by the UK's Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council through its various astronomy programs at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory.

                     ----------------------
                     SOFA Astronomy Library
                     ----------------------


PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA astronomy library.  Their
general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions agreed by
the SOFA Review Board, and their functions, names and algorithms have
been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for soliciting and agreeing
additions to the library are still evolving.

At present the routines are all written in Fortran 77, complying
with the ANSI standard (X3.9-1978) except in two respects:

  (1) All routine names are prefixed with the string "iau_".  If
      necessary, the string can be removed globally;  the result
      is correctly functioning code.

  (2) All routines include an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  This can
      be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

If the "iau_" string and/or the IMPLICIT NONE statements are removed
globally, the resulting code is fully ANSI-compliant and is functionally
unaffected.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The principal function of the SOFA Astronomy Library is to define
algorithms.  A secondary function is to provide software suitable for
direct use by writers of astronomical applications.

The astronomy routines call on the SOFA vector/matrix library routines,
which are separately listed.

The routines are designed to exploit the full floating-point accuracy
of the machines on which they run, and not to rely on compiler
optimizations.  Within these constraints, the intention is that the code
corresponds to the published formulation (if any).

Epochs (or simply "dates") are always Julian Dates (except in calendar
conversion routines) and are expressed as two double precision numbers
which sum to the required value.

A distinction is made between routines that implement IAU-approved
models and those that use those models to create other results.  The
former are referred to as "canonical models" in the preamble comments;
the latter are described as "support routines".

Using the library requires knowledge of positional astronomy and
timescales.  These topics are covered in "Explanatory Supplement to the
Astronomical Almanac", P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), University Science
Books, 1992.  Recent developments are documented in the journals, and
references to the relevant papers are given in the SOFA code as
required.  The IERS Conventions are also an important reference.

                   --------------------------
                   SOFA Vector/Matrix Library
                   --------------------------

PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA vector/matrix library.
Their general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions
agreed by the SOFA Review Board, and their functions, names and
algorithms have been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for
soliciting and agreeing additions to the library are still evolving.

At present the routines are all written in Fortran 77, complying with
the ANSI standard (X3.9-1978) except in two respects:

  (1) All routine names are prefixed with the string "iau_".  If
      necessary, the string can be removed globally;  the result
      is correctly functioning code.

  (2) All routines include an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  This can
      be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

If the "iau_" string and/or the IMPLICIT NONE statements are removed
globally, the resulting code is fully ANSI-compliant and is functionally
unaffected.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The library consists mostly of routines which operate on ordinary
Cartesian vectors (x,y,z) and 3x3 rotation matrices.  However, there is
also support for vectors which represent velocity as well as position
and vectors which represent rotation instead of position.  The vectors
which represent both position and velocity may be considered still to
have dimensions (3), but to comprise elements each of which is two
numbers, representing the value itself and the time derivative.  Thus:

* "Position" or "p" vectors (or just plain 3-vectors) have dimension
  (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.

* "Position/velocity" or "pv" vectors have dimensions (3,2) in Fortran
  and [2][3] in C.

* "Rotation" or "r" matrices have dimensions (3,3) in Fortran and [3][3]
  in C.  When used for rotation, they are "orthogonal";  the inverse of
  such a matrix is equal to the transpose.  Most of the routines in
  this library do not assume that r-matrices are necessarily orthogonal
  and in fact work on any 3x3 matrix.

* "Rotation" or "r" vectors have dimensions (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.
  Such vectors are a combination of the Euler axis and angle and are
  convertible to and from r-matrices.  The direction is the axis of
  rotation and the magnitude is the angle of rotation, in radians.
  Because the amount of rotation can be scaled up and down simply by
  multiplying the vector by a scalar, r-vectors are useful for
  representing spins about an axis which is fixed.

* The above rules mean that in terms of memory address, the three
  velocity components of a pv-vector follow the three position
  components.  Application code is permitted to exploit this and all
  other knowledge of the internal layouts:  that x, y and z appear in
  that order and are in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system etc.
  For example, the cp function (copy a p-vector) can be used to copy
  the velocity component of a pv-vector (indeed, this is how the
  CPV routine is coded).

* The routines provided do not completely fill the range of operations
  that link all the various vector and matrix options, but are confined
  to functions that are required by other parts of the SOFA software or
  which are likely to prove useful.

In addition to the vector/matrix routines, the library contains some
routines related to spherical angles, including conversions to and
from sexagesimal format.

Using the library requires knowledge of vector/matrix methods, spherical
trigonometry, and methods of attitude representation.  These topics are
covered in many textbooks, including "Spacecraft Attitude Determination
and Control", James R. Wertz (ed.), Astrophysics and Space Science
Library, Vol. 73, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1986.

*
*  Notes
*
*  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
*     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
*     pole and the mean J2000 pole.  They define, with respect to the
*     GCRS frame, a J2000 mean pole that is consistent with the rest of
*     the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
*
*  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
*     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
*     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
*     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
*
*  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UTA and
*     UTB.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of

*
*             UTA            UTB

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of UTA,UTB, the
*     date & time method is best matched to the Earth Rotation Angle
*     algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at least, minimum noise) is
*     delivered when the UTA argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UTB argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) XP and YP are the "coordinates of the pole", in radians, which
*     position the Celestial Intermediate Pole in the International
*     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).  In a
*     geocentric right-handed triad u,v,w, where the w-axis points at
*     the north geographic pole, the v-axis points towards the origin
*     of longitudes and the u axis completes the system, XP = +u and
*     YP = -v.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2T transforms from celestial to terrestrial
*     coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference

*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
*     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth Rotation Angle
*     and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     TTA,TTB    d       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*     UTA,UTB    d       UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)

*
*  Returned:
*     RC2T     d(3,3)    celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UTA and
*     UTB.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
*     these ways, among others:
*
*             UTA            UTB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of UTA,UTB, the
*     date & time method is best matched to the Earth Rotation Angle
*     algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at least, minimum noise) is
*     delivered when the UTA argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UTB argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) XP and YP are the "coordinates of the pole", in radians, which
*     position the Celestial Intermediate Pole in the International
*     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).  In a
*     geocentric right-handed triad u,v,w, where the w-axis points at
*     the north geographic pole, the v-axis points towards the origin
*     of longitudes and the u axis completes the system, XP = +u and
*     YP = -v.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2T transforms from celestial to terrestrial
*     coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
*     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth Rotation Angle
*     and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
*
*  4) The present routine is faster, but slightly less accurate (about
*     1 mas), than the iau_C2T00A routine.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_C2I00B   celestial-to-intermediate matrix, IAU 2000B

*     matrix.  One use of the present routine is when generating a

*
*  Notes:

*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,

*     IHMSF     i(4)     hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) NDP is interpreted as follows:
*
*     NDP         resolution
*      :      ...0000 00 00
*     -7         1000 00 00

*      :            0 00 00.000...
*
*  2) The largest positive useful value for NDP is determined by the
*     size of DAYS, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point
*     numbers on the target platform, and the risk of overflowing
*     IHMSF(4).  On a typical platform, for DAYS up to 1D0, the
*     available floating-point precision might correspond to NDP=12.
*     However, the practical limit is typically NDP=9, set by the
*     capacity of a 32-bit IHMSF(4).
*
*  3) The absolute value of DAYS may exceed 1D0.  In cases where it

*                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
*     to call the routine with an earlier epoch.  If this is attempted,
*     zero is returned together with a warning status.
*
*     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
*     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
*     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
*     after the release year of the present routine (see parameter IYV)
*     is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned
*     but the result is computed in the normal way.
*
*     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is J=+1.
*     This is distinct from the error status J=-1, which signifies a
*     year so early that JD could not be computed.
*
*  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
*     the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
*     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
*     second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
*     leap second.
*
*  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
*     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
*     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
*     routine, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
*
*  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction
*     of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.
*     It is tested for validity (zero to less than 1 is the valid range)
*     even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status J=-4 is
*     returned.  For many applications, setting FD to zero is
*     acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
*     occurs only pre-1972).
*
*  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
*     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
*     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, JSTAT=-2 (bad month)
*     will be returned.
*
*  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.

*
*  Returned:
*    iau_DTDB         d   TDB-TT (seconds)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments EPOCH1 and EPOCH2.  For
*     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*           EPOCH1          EPOCH2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*     Although the epoch is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB),
*     the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical
*     effect on the accuracy of the prediction.
*
*  2) TDB is a canonical implementation of the coordinate time in the
*     Solar System barycenter frame of reference, and TT is the proper
*     time given by clocks at mean sea level on the Earth.  The present
*     routine provides a TDB-TT implementation.  The result, which is
*     in seconds, has a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude
*     approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about
*     20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds.
*     The variation arises from the transverse Doppler effect and the
*     gravitational red-shift as the observer varies in speed and
*     experiences different gravitational potentials.
*
*  3) The IAU 1976 definition of TDB was that it must differ from TT
*     (then called TDT) only by periodic terms.  Though practical, this
*     is an imprecise definition which ignores the existence of very
*     long-period and secular effects in the dynamics of the solar
*     system.  Consequently, different implementations of TDB will, in
*     general, have different zero-points and will drift linearly
*     relative to one other.  Subsequent IAU resolutions (1991)
*     introduced new timescales to overcome these objections, namely
*     TCG and TCB (see Seidelmann et al. 1992 for details).
*
*  4) The geocentric model is that of Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in
*     its full form.  It was originally supplied by Fairhead (private
*     communications with P.T.Wallace, 1990) in the form of a Fortran
*     subroutine.  The present routine contains an adaptation of the
*     Fairhead code.  The numerical results are essentially unaffected
*     by the changes, the differences with respect to the Fairhead &
*     Bretagnon original being at the 1E-20 sec level.  This model has
*     been endorsed by the IERS Conventions (1996).
*
*     The topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and
*     Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from
*     Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression
*     ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of
*     the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and
*     c is the speed of light.
*
*     By supplying zeroes for U and V, the topocentric part of the
*     model can be nullified, and the routine will return the Fairhead
*     & Bretagnon result alone.
*
*  5) During the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better
*     than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to direct numerical integrations
*     using the JPL DE200/LE200 solar system ephemeris.
*
*  6) It must be stressed that the present routine is merely a model,
*     and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the
*     definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and
*     TCB.  In particular, published values of L_C, the constant
*     component of the relationship, may not be optimally matched with
*     the periodic component modeled here.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
*     equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
*     mean Sidereal Time:
*
*        GAST = GMST + EE
*
*     with:
*
*        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
*
*     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
*     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
*     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent
*     irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-effects of
*     precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these effects from
*     UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994 (IAU, 1994) and
*     took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier, 1993):
*
*        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
*
*     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of the
*     equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean Sidereal
*     Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical" interpretation
*     of mean sidereal time but is otherwise inconsequential.
*
*     The present routine computes CT in the above expression,
*     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
*     IERS Conventions 2003).

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in
*     any convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*              EPOCH1        EPOCH2

*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the

*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     However, the accuracy of the result is more likely to be
*     limited by the algorithm itself than the way the epoch has been
*     expressed.
*
*  2) On return, the arrays PVH and PVB contain the following:

*
*     The vectors are with respect to the International Celestial
*     Reference Frame.  The time unit is one day in TDB.
*
*  3) The routine is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory
*     VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics &

*     Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).
*
*  4) Comparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified

*  Transform an FK5 (J2000) star position into the frame of the
*  Hipparcos catalogue, assuming zero Hipparcos proper motion.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     R5              d      FK5 RA (radians), equinox J2000, at epoch
*     D5              d      FK5 Dec (radians), equinox J2000, at epoch
*     EPOCH1,EPOCH2   d      TDB epoch (Notes 1,2)
*
*  Returned:
*     RH              d      Hipparcos RA (radians)
*     DH              d      Hipparcos Dec (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine converts a star position from the FK5 system to
*     the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
*     motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
*     proper motion in the FK5 system, the routine requires the epoch
*     at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.
*
*  2) The epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            EPOCH1        EPOCH2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
*     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects
*     have zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general)
*     non-zero proper motion in FK5, and this routine returns those
*     fictitious proper motions.
*
*  5) The position returned by this routine is in the FK5 J2000
*     reference frame but at Julian epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2.

*
*  The result is the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (radians), in the

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in

*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
*     Rotation Angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
*     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
*     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
*
*  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
*     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible components

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 epoch DJ1+DJ2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DJ1 and DJ2.  For example,
*     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises

*     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the DJ1 argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the DJ2 argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is always
*     described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it gives the
*     difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady 4-minutes-per-day
*     drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When whole days are ignored,
*     the expression happens to equal the GMST at 0 hours UT1 each day.
*
*  3) In this routine, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments DJ1
*     and DJ2) is used directly as the argument for the standard formula,
*     the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to take account
*     of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then added, but
*     omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            EPOCH1        EPOCH2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
*     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects
*     have zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general)
*     non-zero proper motion in FK5, and this routine returns those
*     fictitious proper motions.
*
*  5) The position returned by this routine is in the FK5 J2000
*     reference frame but at Julian epoch EPOCH1+EPOCH2.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are with
*     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The obliquity at
*     J2000 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value of
*     84381.448 arcsec.
*
*     Both the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The
*     latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the perturbations
*     of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.
*
*  3) The routine computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the
*     associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an
*     implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession-
*     nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free core
*     nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.
*
*  4) The full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the
*     nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation of
*     the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN
*     terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT
*     included in the present routine and, if required, must be
*     independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the
*     present routine delivers a pole which is at current epochs
*     accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN
*     introduces further errors of about that size.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000
*     algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the
*     offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments
*     in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.
*     These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession
*     adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines iau_BI00 and
*     iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB2000 algorithm also provides "total" nutations, comprising
*     the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments,
*     luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total nutations
*     can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession
*     implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-true
*     predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, there
*     are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that must be taken
*     into account if more accurate or definitive results are required
*     (see Wallace 2002):
*
*       (i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,
*           yet in reality the various components are successive Euler
*           rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms
*           that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure
*           is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the
*           bias, precession and nutation in that order.
*
*      (ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with
*           respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does
*           not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and
*           how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal and
*           straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation
*           epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and to add DPSIPR to
*           psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.
*
*     (iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront
*           et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the J2000
*           mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It should,
*           however, be noted that neglecting this displacement when
*           calculating star coordinates does not lead to a 14.6 mas
*           change in right ascension, only a small second-order
*           distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation effect.
*
*     For these reasons, the SOFA routines do not generate the "total
*     nutations" directly, though they can of course easily be generated
*     by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and the present routine and adding
*     the results.

*
*  Returned:
*     DPSI,DEPS     d   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are with
*     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The obliquity at
*     J2000 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value of
*     84381.448 arcsec.
*
*     The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but includes
*     also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-period
*     planetary terms.
*
*  3) This routine is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
*     nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000.  The routine computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar nutation
*     series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated corrections for
*     the precession rate adjustments and the offset between the GCRS
*     and J2000 mean poles.
*
*  4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
*     terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2001) contains only
*     77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
*     results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
*     accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
*     suitable for most practical applications.
*
*     The routine delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
*     (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside 1 mas).
*     The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the routine
*     iau_NUT00A (qv), delivers considerably greater accuracy at
*     current epochs;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
*     corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
*     must also be included.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The
*     MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
*     with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
*     adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
*     precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
*     and precession adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines
*     iau_BI00 and iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
*     comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
*     adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
*     nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
*     precession implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-
*     true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, for
*     symmetry with the iau_NUT00A routine (qv for the reasons), the
*     SOFA routines do not generate the "total nutations" directly.  They
*     can of course easily be generated by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and
*     the present routine and adding the results.

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     The limited accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any
*     of the methods is satisfactory.
*
*  2) If an NP value outside the range 1-8 is supplied, an error
*     status (J = -1) is returned and the PV vector set to zeroes.
*
*  3) For NP=3 the result is for the Earth-Moon Barycenter.  To
*     obtain the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth,
*     use instead the SOFA routine iau_EPV00.
*
*  4) On successful return, the array PV contains the following:
*
*        PV(1,1)  x       }
*        PV(2,1)  y       } heliocentric position, AU
*        PV(3,1)  z       }
*
*        PV(1,2)  xdot    }
*        PV(2,2)  ydot    } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
*        PV(3,2)  zdot    }
*
*     The reference frame is equatorial and is with respect to the
*     mean equator and equinox of epoch J2000.
*
*  5) The algorithm is due to J.L. Simon, P. Bretagnon, J. Chapront,
*     M. Chapront-Touze, G. Francou and J. Laskar (Bureau des
*     Longitudes, Paris, France).  From comparisons with JPL
*     ephemeris DE102, they quote the following maximum errors
*     over the interval 1800-2050:
*
*                     L (arcsec)    B (arcsec)      R (km)
*
*        Mercury          4             1             300
*        Venus            5             1             800
*        EMB              6             1            1000
*        Mars            17             1            7700
*        Jupiter         71             5           76000
*        Saturn          81            13          267000
*        Uranus          86             7          712000
*        Neptune         11             1          253000
*
*     Over the interval 1000-3000, they report that the accuracy is no
*     worse than 1.5 times that over 1800-2050.  Outside 1000-3000 the
*     accuracy declines.
*
*     Comparisons of the present routine with the JPL DE200 ephemeris
*     give the following RMS errors over the interval 1960-2025:
*
*                      position (km)     velocity (m/s)
*
*        Mercury            334               0.437
*        Venus             1060               0.855
*        EMB               2010               0.815
*        Mars              7690               1.98
*        Jupiter          71700               7.70
*        Saturn          199000              19.4
*        Uranus          564000              16.4
*        Neptune         158000              14.4
*
*     Comparisons against DE200 over the interval 1800-2100 gave the
*     following maximum absolute differences.  (The results using
*     DE406 were essentially the same.)
*
*                   L (arcsec)   B (arcsec)     R (km)   Rdot (m/s)
*
*        Mercury        7            1            500       0.7

*        Jupiter       78            6          82000       8.2
*        Saturn        87           14         263000      24.6
*        Uranus        86            7         661000      27.4
*        Neptune       11            2         248000      21.4
*
*  6) The present SOFA re-implementation of the original Simon et al.
*     Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:
*
*       *  The date is supplied in two parts.
*
*       *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
*          the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
*          returned.
*
*       *  The result is in the J2000 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.
*
*       *  More is done in-line:  there are fewer calls to other
*          routines.
*
*       *  Different error/warning status values are used.
*
*       *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
*          use of COMPLEX*16).
*
*       *  Polynomials in T are nested to minimize rounding errors.
*
*       *  Explicit double-precision constants are used to avoid
*          mixed-mode expressions.
*
*       *  There are other, cosmetic, changes to comply with SOFA
*          style conventions.
*
*     None of the above changes affects the result significantly.
*
*  7) The returned status, J, indicates the most serious condition
*     encountered during execution of the routine.  Illegal NP is
*     considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge,
*     which in turn takes precedence over the remote epoch warning.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) XP and YP are the "coordinates of the pole", in radians, which
*     position the Celestial Intermediate Pole in the International
*     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).  In a
*     geocentric right-handed triad u,v,w, where the w-axis points at

*     of longitudes and the u axis completes the system, XP = +u and
*     YP = -v.
*
*  2) SP is the quantity s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial
*     Ephemeris Origin on the equator.  It is obtained from polar motion
*     observations by numerical integration, and so is in essence
*     unpredictable.  However, it is dominated by a secular drift of
*     about 47 microarcseconds per century, and so can be taken into
*     account by using s' = -47*t, where t is centuries since J2000.
*     The routine iau_SP00 implements this approximation.
*

*

*
*  1) The T date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation components",
*     corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect to the J2000
*     equinox and ecliptic.
*
*  3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
*     to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
*     set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
*     be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
*     adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
*     to add DPSIPR to psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A
*     (Wallace 2002).
*
*  4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
*     model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
*     namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

*
*  This routine forms the three Euler angles which implement general
*  precession between two epochs, using the IAU 1976 model (as for
*  the FK5 catalog).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     EP01,EP02   d      TDB starting epoch (Note 1)
*     EP11,EP12   d      TDB ending epoch (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     ZETA        d      1st rotation: radians clockwise around z
*     Z           d      3rd rotation: radians clockwise around z
*     THETA       d      2nd rotation: radians counterclockwise around y
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The epochs EP01+EP02 and EP11+EP12 are Julian Dates, apportioned
*     in any convenient way between the arguments EPn1 and EPn2.  For
*     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*             EPn1          EPn2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     The two epochs may be expressed using different methods, but at
*     the risk of losing some resolution.
*
*  2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
*     through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
*     time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to
*     be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation is
*     better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec
*     from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of
*     the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside
*     the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
*     5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to
*     8200AD.
*
*  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
*     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.
*     The precession matrix is R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).

*                          -2 = null position vector
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
*     of change) for the epoch at which the light leaving the star
*     reached the solar-system barycenter.
*
*  2) The star data returned by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely to be
*     merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
*     routine iau_STARPV), so that a change of time unit will cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
*     differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
*     below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
*     year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
*     true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
*     declinations.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
*     assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
*     light, the routine aborts with an error status.
*
*  6) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_STARPV.

*
*  Returned:
*     iau_S00        d      the quantity s in radians (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The quantity s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CEO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The quantity s remains a small fraction of
*     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
*     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  This routine
*     requires X,Y to be supplied by the caller, who is responsible for
*     providing values that are consistent with the supplied date.

*  1) The starting and ending TDB epochs EP1A+EP1B and EP2A+EP2B are
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
*     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
*     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
*
*             EPnA          EPnB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
*     Julian year.
*
*     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the iau_STARPV routine
*     for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in this way,
*     the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX in the routine iau_STARPV), it is arbitrarily set to
*     zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iau_STARPV routine
*     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
*     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
*     status.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_STARPV   star catalog data to space motion pv-vector
*     iau_PVU      update a pv-vector
*     iau_PDP      p-vector dot product
*     iau_PVSTAR   space motion pv-vector to star catalog data

*                           1 = distance overridden (Note 6)
*                           2 = excessive velocity (Note 7)
*                           4 = solution didn't converge (Note 8)
*                        else = binary logical OR of the above
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The star data accepted by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the pv-vector is likely to be merely an
*     intermediate result, so that a change of time unit would cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*  2) The resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to
*     the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from
*     the effects of secular aberration.  Should the "coordinate
*     direction", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be
*     required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the
*     position vector PV(1-3,1) dividing by the speed of light in AU/day
*     to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space velocity
*     PV(1-3,2) by this light-time and adding the result to PV(1-3,1).
*
*     Summarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation.  The differences, which are the
*     subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN).
*     When the distance is overridden in this way, the status, initially
*     zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action
*     occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation.
*     If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of
*     iterations, 4 is added to the status.
*
*  9) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_PVSTAR.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_S2PV     spherical coordinates to pv-vector
*     iau_PM       modulus of p-vector
*     iau_ZP       zero a p-vector
