                   --------------------------
                   SOFA Vector/Matrix Library
                   --------------------------

PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA vector/matrix library.
Their general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions
agreed by the SOFA Review Board, and their functions, names and
algorithms have been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for
soliciting and agreeing additions to the library are still evolving.

At present the routines are all written in Fortran 77, complying with
the ANSI standard (X3.9-1978) except in two respects:

  (1) All routine names are prefixed with the string "iau_".  If
      necessary, the string can be removed globally;  the result
      is correctly functioning code.

  (2) All routines include an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  This can
      be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

If the "iau_" string and/or the IMPLICIT NONE statements are removed
globally, the resulting code is fully ANSI-compliant and is functionally
unaffected.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The library consists mostly of routines which operate on ordinary
Cartesian vectors (x,y,z) and 3x3 rotation matrices.  However, there is
also support for vectors which represent velocity as well as position
and vectors which represent rotation instead of position.  The vectors
which represent both position and velocity may be considered still to
have dimensions (3), but to comprise elements each of which is two
numbers, representing the value itself and the time derivative.  Thus:

* "Position" or "p" vectors (or just plain 3-vectors) have dimension
  (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.

* "Position/velocity" or "pv" vectors have dimensions (3,2) in Fortran
  and [2][3] in C.

* "Rotation" or "r" matrices have dimensions (3,3) in Fortran and [3][3]
  in C.  When used for rotation, they are "orthogonal";  the inverse of
  such a matrix is equal to the transpose.  Most of the routines in
  this library do not assume that r-matrices are necessarily orthogonal
  and in fact work on any 3x3 matrix.

* "Rotation" or "r" vectors have dimensions (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.
  Such vectors are a combination of the Euler axis and angle and are
  convertible to and from r-matrices.  The direction is the axis of
  rotation and the magnitude is the angle of rotation, in radians.
  Because the amount of rotation can be scaled up and down simply by
  multiplying the vector by a scalar, r-vectors are useful for
  representing spins about an axis which is fixed.

* The above rules mean that in terms of memory address, the three
  velocity components of a pv-vector follow the three position
  components.  Application code is permitted to exploit this and all
  other knowledge of the internal layouts:  that x, y and z appear in
  that order and are in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system etc.
  For example, the cp function (copy a p-vector) can be used to copy
  the velocity component of a pv-vector (indeed, this is how the
  CPV routine is coded).

* The routines provided do not completely fill the range of operations
  that link all the various vector and matrix options, but are confined
  to functions that are required by other parts of the SOFA software or
  which are likely to prove useful.

In addition to the vector/matrix routines, the library contains some
routines related to spherical angles, including conversions to and
from sexagesimal format.

Using the library requires knowledge of vector/matrix methods, spherical
trigonometry, and methods of attitude representation.  These topics are
covered in many textbooks, including "Spacecraft Attitude Determination
and Control", James R. Wertz (ed.), Astrophysics and Space Science
Library, Vol. 73, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1986.
